# Advent of code 2024 ðŸŽ„

This advent I'll try to participate in [aoc](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

My first ever.

Wish me luck!

## How to run examples

Use `make run DAY={number}` and you will get the results. Or run all with `make all`

Example:

```shell
make run DAY=1

...

make run DAY=3

make all
```
